# Yabash

## Introduction

Yabash is a restaurant application created majorly with the python Django functionality. The restaurant can take orders from a user and store the booking details in the user's booking records for later access. This booking(s) can be assessed, updated or cancelled as seen fit by the user. As a result, the app harnesses the full functionality of CRUD. The app also considers posting testimonials of their visitors reported on their social media platforms through the admin panel. The website considers a Design Thinking approach, Agile methodology for structure, and for UX/UI Design Bootstrap technology was implemented throughout, see below in the technology section, for a list of technologies used.

A mixture of this color was made with #182424. A dark green kind of color and its lighter version #d7e3e3 and a neutral #fff.

### Typography

The contents of the website is required to be clear and legible for users. Poppins was the choice for typographic design as it answers the question of readability well with a fallback font of sans-serif.
